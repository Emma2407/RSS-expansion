(https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/184530-13x-18x-real-expansion)


 * RSS-expansion v0.4 *

 stuff included:
	-Haumea
	-Namaka
	-Hi'iaka

known issiues:
	-you can only land at the poles of Haumea, getting near the equator destroys your craft and the ground textures there aren't great
	-sometimes you can see the ring of haumea through the surface

planned:
	-fixing Haumea
	-(16) Psyche


Thank you for giving this mod a chance, it is my first attempt. I really hope you are having fun
